This project is about similarity test. 
This asks people a set of random questions from questions.txt and then takes their answers. 
Then this processes the data from user and then asks the user for a file to be compared with then inputs the data from the file.
Then compares and outputs the person who is most similar the user based on the answers the user gives. 
This continues to compare the data with different files till the user does not quit.
